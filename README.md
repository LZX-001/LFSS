It is the code for LFSS (Learning from Sample Stability for Deep Clustering)

## Training
```bash
torchrun  --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port 4831 train.py
```
You may choose a save_dir to save checkpoints and logs. 

And you can adjust the experimental setup and hyperparameters in the main.py.

## Test
```bash
torchrun  --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port 4831 test.py
```
use the specific svae_dir and checkpoint for testing.
